    <blockquote>
<p>My memos are short, subjective and not exhaustively researched thoughts about issues I currently face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very trendy to have a mono-repository for your projects because &quot;<strong>aLl tHe bIg fOuR Do iT</strong>&quot; which is of course an empty argument. For the fundamentals I suggest reading the report about the <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext">workflow at Google</a> which lists all advantages and disadvantages of working with a singular large codebase. Of course there have been many articles about the mono- vs poly-repositories debate, none which I could recommend as they are all highly subjective and often lack arguments.</p>
<p>Therefore I am not going to argue for one side or the other, also because they face very similar issues: they both require rather specific tools and immense DevOps effort at scale. However, my current position can be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a very good idea for many use cases to start with a mono-repository (and a mono-/module-lithic architecture) and <strong>evolve</strong> with the requirements and processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course you should not be dealing in absolutes and use argumentative reasoning based on the individual issue at hand and cut the boundaries much like we do in DDD.</p>
<p>No matter which path you will choose, you should be painfully aware of the issues that will ultimately arise if you try to force your existing tooling - which was constructed with poly-repositories in mind - onto this new paradigm. There is a reason the <em>GAFA</em> needs to invest heavily into their tooling and almost all of it is highly specific and self-developed. They do not use the typical branching model, peer review process or continuous integration tools which we all know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the long term you will need to evaluate your position to make a substantial investment which is required to scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common mistake that will hurt you in the long run and which is easy to mitigate, is to use the <em>Giflow</em> branching model instead of <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com">trunk-based development</a>. All projects that switched to a monorepo-structure I have seen so far did this and struggled immensely.</p>
<p>Sooner or later however you will face a more challenging issue: Most of us use <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos">Git</a> for version control which is the worst choice for a large monorepo. You will need to fetch every commit and every ref. There are many <a href="https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo#git"><strong>hacks</strong></a> which try to hammer Git in shape for monorepos but they cannot change the concept of the design and I am not aware of any free VCS that specifically supports large-scale monorepos. Furthermore, it seems The Big Four already evaluated all of the available offerings, open-source and commercial, and decided to build their own solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you ready to build your own VCS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I almost cannot imagine a company that would see the business value in answering &quot;Yes&quot; to this question.</p>
<h2>Postscript</h2>
<p>I was made aware of <a href="https://vfsforgit.org">VFS for Git</a> which advertises with great statistics but have not tried it yet.</p>
