    <p>I am a full-stack software engineer who studied computer science and computational linguistics in the beautiful city of Heidelberg and live near Karlsruhe, Germany.</p>
<p>With over 12 years of experience, my passion is to design and implement products with state‐of‐the‐art technologies and focus on simplicity.</p>
<p>I prefer to work closely with stakeholders to ensure a product‐driven development that solves real‐world problems to benefit the end‐user. I thrive in an inclusive and diverse environment and enjoy working with people from different backgrounds and cultures.</p>
<p>Being a teacher, mentor and servant leader and seeing others grow gives me as sense of accomplishment. I have extensive experience building teams from the ground up and enabling others.</p>
<p>I love Asia, in particular Japan and it's culture and aesthetics is the underlying motive in my work. I strongly believe in simplicity, liberty and professional commitment.</p>
<p>Last but not least, my most valuable skill is adaptability and curiosity as I am a lifelong learner.</p>
