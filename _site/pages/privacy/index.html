    <p>As a consumer and creator I am very concerned about privacy. Not only do I honor current European and German law but also adhere to strict ethics which means that I do not actively collect any personal information nor would I ever give data to third parties.</p>
<p>There are no advertisement or analytics tools. No plugins or social media integration. No external requests are done whether it be for fonts, libraries or stylesheets since everything is statically included in the build. There is no persistence of personal data on the client-side whether it be cookies or the browser storage. Not even a simple form. Although no critical information is transferred and therefore HTTPS/TLS is not strictly required, it is provided.</p>
<p>However, the browser automatically sends information to the server which are classified as communication data and therefore personal information, e.g. the IP address. This behavior can not be changed. Nevertheless, I have a data processing agreement with the hosting company to capture this data and also I can not guarantee or be liable that the hoster itself does not run analytics on the data.
