I am a full-stack software engineer who studied computer science and computational linguistics in the beautiful city of Heidelberg and live near Karlsruhe, Germany.

With over 12 years of experience, my passion is to design and implement products with state‐of‐the‐art technologies and focus on simplicity.

I prefer to work closely with stakeholders to ensure a product‐driven development that solves real‐world problems to benefit the end‐user. I thrive in an inclusive and diverse environment and enjoy working with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

Being a teacher, mentor and servant leader and seeing others grow gives me as sense of accomplishment. I have extensive experience building teams from the ground up and enabling others.

I love Asia, in particular Japan and it's culture and aesthetics is the underlying motive in my work. I strongly believe in simplicity, liberty and professional commitment.

Last but not least, my most valuable skill is adaptability and curiosity as I am a lifelong learner.
